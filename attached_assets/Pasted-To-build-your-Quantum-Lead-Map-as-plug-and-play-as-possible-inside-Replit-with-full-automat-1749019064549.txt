To build your **Quantum Lead Map** as **plug-and-play** as possible inside Replit *with full automation when possible* and fallback **manual input routed via Playwright or Puppeteer**, here’s the *exact plan* to make that happen without slowing you down:

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: **EZ Mode Stack Selection (No Friction)**

We pick components with:

* 🔌 *Instant Replit support*
* 👤 *Manual interaction → automation mapping*
* 💥 *QQ readiness + fast AI scoring*

| Component                 | Tool                               | Why It Works Immediately in Replit                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌍 Lead Map Engine        | **Leaflet.js** or **Mapbox GL JS** | Pure JS, easy to render in Flask/React SPA                  |
| 📦 Database Layer         | **Supabase (Postgres + Geo)**      | Built-in support + real-time updates                        |
| 🔁 Lead Logic             | **Flask + Python QQ logic**        | Already part of your architecture                           |
| 📍 Puppeteer / Playwright | For fallback/manual input          | Controlled manual data entry (like email, zip, geolocation) |

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 2: **Flow Structure with Automation & Interaction Hook**

### 🔧 Setup Block (First Time Only)

```plaintext
→ Drop the ZIP into Replit
→ System boot checks:
   - Supabase URL / Key set?
   - Mapbox token provided?
   - QQ Lead scoring config present?
→ If missing, activate fallback script with:
   - Playwright/Puppeteer auto-prompt
   - OR: Interactive CLI to finish
```

> ✅ Example: If you didn’t pre-provide your Mapbox token, it’ll spawn a Puppeteer window, ask for it visually, store it in `.env`, and reboot clean.

---

### 🔁 Real-Time Use Flow

```plaintext
User lands → form fills → lead scored by QQ Model → plotted on map (w/ geo enrichment) → optional SMS/email sent via Twilio → all tracked silently
```

---

## 🧠 PHASE 3: **Plug-and-Play Puppeteer Script Integration**

We'll wrap every manual fallback in Puppeteer like this:

### Example Script: `fallback_input_puppeteer.py`

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
import os

def launch_fallback_prompt():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("http://localhost:8000/setup")  # Your lead map setup route
        page.fill("#mapbox_token", os.getenv("MAPBOX_TOKEN") or "")
        page.fill("#supabase_url", os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL") or "")
        page.click("button#submit_setup")
        page.wait_for_timeout(3000)
        browser.close()
```

Then your Flask route catches that setup and finishes bootstrapping.

---

## 🧩 PHASE 4: Full Replit-Ready Prompt (Final Plug Command)

```plaintext
Inject Quantum Lead Map into DWC:
- Use Leaflet.js base
- Flask + Supabase for backend, with QQ Lead Scoring logic
- Setup detects missing ENV (Mapbox, Supabase), triggers Puppeteer/Playwright interactive fallback
- Plot leads in real-time with colorized scoring overlays and live tracking
- All routes under /dashboard/lead-map, auth protected
- Store user choices and hash results into AI-enhanced lead logs
```

---

## 🧰 Deployment Bundle Includes:

* `/templates/lead_map.html` (with real-time updates)
* `/static/js/map_engine.js` (Leaflet + dynamic overlays)
* `/scripts/fallback_input_puppeteer.py`
* `/routes/leadmap_routes.py` (Flask blueprint)
* `lead_scoring.py` (your QQ logic module)
* `.env.example` with token placeholders
* Replit-ready boot script with self-checks + first-time wizard

---

## 🚀 NEXT:

If you’re ready, just say:
**“Build and ZIP the full Lead Map Quantum Package now.”**

I’ll deliver the ZIP + a monospace Replit prompt to drop in instantly, including Puppeteer/Playwright fallback for anything you don’t prefill. This means the app will ask **only when absolutely needed**, otherwise it flies fully automated.
