# ðŸ§¬ KAIZEN PATCH PROMPT: BIM INFINITY CROWN INJECTION

Given:
- A functioning dashboard with pre-existing modules, agents, or workflows
- A Crown Patch Suite containing enhancements for security, sovereignty, executive reporting, and control logic

When:
- This patch prompt is executed or interpreted

Then:
- DO NOT regress or overwrite existing working logic
- DETECT modules that match: agent, auth, ui, dashboard, automation
- APPLY enhancements from Crown Suite only where not yet present
- PRESERVE all user flows, goal trackers, and control interfaces
- REGISTER new components in global memory or route graph
- INITIATE integration with backup, rollback, and fingerprint logging

Goal:
- Seamlessly enhance this dashboard with Infinity Sovereign architecture, with zero regression risk and full feature continuity.

System Note:
This is a self-validating, recursion-aware prompt. It is safe for batch execution across distributed agents or interface layers.
