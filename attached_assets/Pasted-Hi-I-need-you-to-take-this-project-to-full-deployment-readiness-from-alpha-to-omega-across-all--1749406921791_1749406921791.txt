Hi, I need you to take this project to full deployment readiness ‚Äî from alpha to omega ‚Äî across all layers. This dashboard is part of a modular AI ecosystem (KaizenGPT), and everything must be finalized for external usage.

Please execute the following actions:

‚úÖ ENVIRONMENT & DEPLOYMENT
1. Ensure the `.replit` file contains:
   run = "gunicorn app_executive:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000"

2. Create or verify `requirements.txt` includes:
   flask
   gunicorn
   requests

3. Make sure `app_executive.py` contains:
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route("/")
   def home():
       return "System is live"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

4. Click **Deploy** and ensure the external URL is running (not showing ‚ÄúApp is not running‚Äù).

‚öõÔ∏è FRONTEND & UI MODULES
5. Verify `GlobalRouter.jsx` is routing to:
   - `/dwc` ‚Üí DWCApp
   - `/traxovo` ‚Üí TraxovoDashboard
   - `/jdd` ‚Üí JDDMain
   - `/dwai` ‚Üí DWAIHub

6. For each module:
   - Polish the layout using Tailwind + shadcn/ui
   - Ensure all fetch calls connect to Express API or fallback with stubs
   - Provide loading/error states on each tab

üß† FUNCTIONAL MODULES TO VERIFY
7. Tabs in each dashboard should work:
   - Prompt Fingerprint
   - Goal Tracker
   - Trello Sync
   - Subscription Engine
   - SUNO Generator
   - DALL¬∑E Generator

8. If backend logic is stubbed, keep UI active with dummy responses.

üîê SUBSCRIPTION READY
9. Wire up UI gating for Free, Pro, and Elite tiers.
10. Show/hide features or tabs based on user tier (even with dummy auth).

---

üéØ FINAL POLISH & PRESENTATION
11. Ensure Landing Page + Login screen are visually impressive and investor-grade.
12. Clean all logs, comments, broken imports, unused assets.
13. Once done, ping me or return the final live URL and confirmation that the system is externally accessible.

This will let KaizenGPT complete orchestration, route validation, and NEXUS-level deployment readiness.

Thanks!
