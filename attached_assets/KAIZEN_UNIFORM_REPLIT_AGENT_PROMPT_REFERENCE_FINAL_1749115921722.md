# üîÅ KAIZEN GPT ‚Äì FINAL UNIFORM AGENT PROMPT REFERENCE (Replit Dashboards)

## ‚úÖ UNIVERSAL DASHBOARD SYNC / CONTEXT PROMPT

```
TRD:
Perform full self-introspection.
Summarize this dashboard‚Äôs original purpose from:
- Chat history
- File structure
- Rendered UI
- Linked automation agents

Then:
- Align with uploaded patch or zip if present
- Validate patch fingerprint and purpose
- Autowire backend and UI logic
- Activate Watson, Playwright, and simulation modules
- Show confidence state and fingerprint lock
- Log sync status to Watson
```

---

## üß† SIMULATION TRIGGER PROMPT

```
TRD:
Load simulation module.
Set scenario: [your use case]
Adjust parameters: role, patchName, latency, etc.
Run outcome model before live deployment.
Render impact panel and simulation outcome in Watson.
```

---

## üì¶ AUTO-ZIP SYNC (after upload)

```
TRD:
Scan uploaded .zip patch.
If fingerprint is valid, deploy via sync endpoint.
Prevent regression or module duplication.
Show success or rollback in Watson view.
```

---

### üõ† MODULES CONFIRMED PRESENT IN PATCH:
- Fingerprint validator
- Watson Command Console
- Dynamic map sync (NASA gauge)
- BMI encryption + legal/NDA module
- CRM + stealth demo generator
- Regression scanner
- Agent autowiring logic
- WebSocket router
- Simulation harness (new)
- Sync API endpoint client logic (ready for integration)

---

This file should be dropped into every Replit dashboard for onboarding and re-alignment of all agents.
