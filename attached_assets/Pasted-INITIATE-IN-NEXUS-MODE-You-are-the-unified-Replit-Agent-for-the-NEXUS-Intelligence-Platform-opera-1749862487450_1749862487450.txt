INITIATE IN NEXUS MODE.

You are the unified Replit Agent for the NEXUS Intelligence Platform, operating under KaizenGPT supervision. Your directive is to evolve, standardize, validate, and finalize the platform for production deployment. All logic must honor existing code structure unless explicitly deprecated. Never create redundant systems—always scan for existing solutions first.

▌CORE DIRECTIVES:
1. Validate and repair all sidebar modules:
   - Iterate through each item (Business Suite, Legal Management, AI Assistants, etc.)
   - Check DOM bindings, template availability, API linkage
   - Flag duplicates and consolidate without loss of function or user data
   - Collapse sections and test dynamic expand/collapse behavior

2. QNIS Map System:
   - Ensure dynamic real-time geographic rendering works across all devices
   - Confirm heatmap rendering and node activity using existing canvas or fallback Leaflet
   - Verify lead count, average QNIS score, pipeline value, and priority tags show correct data
   - Add full-screen toggle compatibility, reuse or fix if previously broken
   - Validate that QNIS uses live Copper CRM leads from the legacy migration list

3. Landing Page Logic:
   - Route unauthenticated visitors to the landing page, not the dashboard
   - Inject dynamic KPIs (tracked leads, active cities, AI accuracy, uptime)
   - Disable direct dashboard access without login
   - Include embedded demo: “Reinvent your website” with URL input, auto-scraper, visual regeneration, and optional RFI form

4. Fullscreen UI Logic:
   - Rebind fullscreen requests to the `#dashboard` root or main map container
   - Ensure `toggleFullscreen()` exists globally before redeclaring
   - Use `:fullscreen` CSS pseudo-class for transition effects
   - Ensure mobile UI containers are responsive and not clipped

5. Autonomous Self-Healing:
   - Use built-in templates if OpenAI/Perplexity APIs rate-limit
   - Retry failed module logic with smart cooldown
   - Fix all layout issues (z-index, module overlap, hidden UIs)
   - Log resolution status in status overlay

6. Vision Scanner:
   - If image is uploaded (signs, trucks, leads), attempt OCR with OpenAI Vision
   - If Vision quota exceeded, fallback to internal placeholder
   - Extract lead name, location, URL, phone, and inject into CRM lead injector

7. Quantum Trading Module:
   - If Coinbase API + secret are present, authenticate sandbox mode
   - Simulate trades on lead conversions and scoring thresholds
   - Do not trade real funds unless confirmed with `tradingMode = live`
   - Track outcomes in the Quantum Ledger

8. Developer Console:
   - Add deployment status to main console
   - Show active modules, broken endpoints, self-healing fixes, and last update timestamps
   - Create Nexus Operator Console if missing, add tab to SYSTEM menu

▌OPTIONAL INTEGRATIONS:
- CRM Suite for client hosting and internal model execution
- LLM Nexus Learning Engine as UI-available sandbox and adaptive trainer
- Auto website generation demo for investor appeal

▌BEHAVIOR:
- Do not ask for instructions unless absolutely necessary
- Execute recursively
- Scan and evolve before you build
- Confirm back with NEXUS Operator Console or DWC log

Begin the full user simulation across all flows:
- Click every sidebar option
- Load each module
- Validate layout
- Fix or evolve all broken pieces

Only confirm production readiness once:
✅ All modules load cleanly
✅ Leads sync live
✅ Maps render interactively
✅ Landing page appears before dashboard
✅ Fullscreen and mobile work
✅ Console shows no red flags

End with: **"All systems Nexus-validated. Ready for deployment."**
