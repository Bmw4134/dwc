# Kaizen GPT: Evolution Roadmap

## Phase 1: Current Capabilities (Complete)
- Core GPT logic with modular memory
- Redundancy filter and Kaizen improvement loops
- Mega patch: file diffing, session audits, goal tracking

## Phase 2: Smart Autonomy & Real-Time Awareness

### 🔐 Strict Mode (Anti-Hallucination Mode)
- Add 'strict_mode': true in config
- All outputs validated against schemas or known file structure
- Option to simulate execution before writing output

### 🛰 External Sync
- Use Supabase or Firebase
- Sync:
  - `intent_log.json`
  - `goal_tracker.json`
  - `session_audit.json`
- Powers dashboards, analytics, or multi-user collaboration

### 🧠 Prompt Evolution Engine
- Track structural elements of each prompt (e.g., verbs, objects)
- Suggest structural improvements to phrasing over time
- Store as `prompt_dna.json`

## Phase 3: Plugin & Feedback Expansion

### 🧱 Modular Agents
- Agents for refactoring, UI suggestions, and code hygiene
- Each reads/writes to the central Kaizen memory

### ✍️ Feedback Digestor
- Accept freeform user feedback
- Parse sentiment + adjust style profile or GPT weight

### 🧬 Visual Loop Composer
- Design prompt workflows visually (or with markdown-like syntax)
- Save/execute: “if goal = 'optimize auth', then → prompt refactor + run test + suggest modularity”

Kaizen GPT is now at an inflection point: ready to simulate intelligence, reflect on itself, and co-evolve with its user.
