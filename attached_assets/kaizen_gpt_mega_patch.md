## MASTER MEGA PATCH: Final System Intelligence Enhancements for Kaizen GPT

### 1. Self-Diff Engine (diff_watcher.py)
- Monitors all tracked files.
- Logs diffs with timestamps and auto-summarizes changes.
- Powers reflective prompts like: "This file changed 3 times. Reuse logic?"

### 2. Prompt Fingerprinting (fingerprint.json)
- Each prompt hashed on input.
- Detects prompt overlap, suggests rewrites or merges to reduce cognitive drift.
- Example fields: prompt_text, hash_key, usage_count, timestamp.

### 3. LLM Test Harness (llm_test.py)
- Run post-output sanity checks for hallucination filtering.
- Assert types, values, expected keys/structure.
- Example: ensure generated dict has valid keys and lengths match data source.

### 4. Dev Compass Document (dev_compass.md)
- Living documentation of the system's true north.
- Guides GPT decisions to maintain architectural consistency.
- Includes:
  - Project purpose
  - UI/UX principles
  - Feature backlog themes
  - Don't Do rules

### 5. Session Time Auditor (session_audit.json)
- Log:
  - Start/end time of dev sessions
  - Files touched
  - Time elapsed per file
- Power: prompt to suggest breaks, optimization points, or fatigue flags.

### 6. Goal Tracker System (goal_tracker.json)
- Each prompt or commit links to a user goal.
- GPT checks if the goal advanced and logs it.
- Fields: goal_text, linked_prompt_ids, status, last_updated
