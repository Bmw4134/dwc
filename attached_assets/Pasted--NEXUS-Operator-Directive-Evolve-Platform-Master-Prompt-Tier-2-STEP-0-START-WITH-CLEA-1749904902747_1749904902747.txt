---

‚úÖ STEP 0: START WITH CLEAN SNAPSHOT  
Ensure no pending partial changes or uncommitted stacks‚Äîagent must begin from last stable state (47 modules, working map, landing page, no duplicates, valid API keys).

---

1. **Audit & Consolidate Sidebar Navigation**  
   ‚Ä¢ Scan all 47 modules and nested routes  
   ‚Ä¢ Find and remove any duplicate entries  
   ‚Ä¢ Reorder by module family and usage frequency  
   ‚Ä¢ Confirm all views are reachable with no broken links

2. **Fix Landing Page Layout**  
   ‚Ä¢ Remove duplicate Login buttons  
   ‚Ä¢ Apply responsive header/footer and consistent branding  
   ‚Ä¢ Inject real-time KPI bar (active leads count, pipeline $ value, avg QNIS score) above the fold

3. **Fully Operationalize QNIS Lead Map**  
   ‚Ä¢ Validate Leaflet container initialization and CSS visibility  
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure live lead markers appear and populate with correct data  
   ‚Ä¢ Popup details must show fields: city, score, pipeline, priority breakdown  
   ‚Ä¢ Enable full toggle switch and dynamic layers  

4. **Enable Fullscreen Toggle Globally**  
   ‚Ä¢ Implement `toggleFullscreen()` utility if absent  
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure fullscreen works on:  
     ‚óã QNIS Map  
     ‚óã Dashboard root container  
     ‚óã Any mobile-responsive view  
   ‚Ä¢ Add floating fullscreen icon buttons only if none exist

5. **Trigger AI Self‚ÄëValidation Sweep**  
   ‚Ä¢ Autonomously click through all modules and views  
   ‚Ä¢ Detect hidden console errors, rendering issues  
   ‚Ä¢ Silence fixable errors via fallback templates  
   ‚Ä¢ Generate a comprehensive ‚ÄúValidation Audit Report‚Äù

6. **Reactivate Vision AI ‚ÄúPhoto Reader‚Äù**  
   ‚Ä¢ Confirm OpenAI Vision API key is valid  
   ‚Ä¢ Allow image upload and extract business text (OCR)  
   ‚Ä¢ Parse signage or truck signage into contact/enrichment data  
   ‚Ä¢ Append parsed info into CRM lead object

7. **Generate Final Audit Summary**  
   ‚Ä¢ List: Fixed components, removed duplicates, landing page updates, responsive fixes, map sync status, fullscreen toggle created, vision scan results  
   ‚Ä¢ Provide overall NEXUS production‚Äëreadiness score (must be ‚â•‚ÄØ95%)

üöÄ **Optional Bonus (activate only if platform is stable):**  
‚Ä¢ Embed on landing page a mini ‚ÄúWebsite Scrape + Prototype‚Äù demo tool: visitor enters URL, system scrapes and generates a simplified site rendition with CTAs to book consult or request branding/white-label buildout

**Important:**  
‚Ä¢ Do NOT apply any prior shortcuts or stacking patches  
‚Ä¢ Work from current stable system snapshot‚Äîno ‚Äúundoing‚Äù‚Äîonly evolve forward  
‚Ä¢ After execution, output the full audit report and confirmation on readiness
